# https://ukrainehelp.hu

A simple, 3-language starting page for people fleeing Ukraine to Hungary who are looking for the latest useful information on a variety of topics, including crossing the border, finding accomodation or medical care, legal information or sources related to fleeing with pets or travelling further.

The website contains only the _most essential_ information for _refugees_. It's aim is to provide a spring board with useful references to find further information or portals. It is not an all-encompassing wiki or a detailed description or collection of all sources. It is also not a website aimed at informing or promoting organizations or people offering help.

Contributions are welcome.
